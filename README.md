# openweather-collector

This repository collects hourly weather data of my hometown Zistersdorf and commits them to this repository with Github actions.

It is collected from https://openweathermap.org/


The data can be found in the `./data` directory and contains the daily data in [JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/) files.
